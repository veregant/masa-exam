*No restrictions on online resources usage. You also may use your development machine for assistance in debugging if needed.*

16. **You received a bug stating the following: "Intermittently the following method results in a system getting stuck." You're required to find and fix the problem in this method:** *=> 10 points*

		public static addMonths(date: Date, value: number): Date {
		    let expectedMonth: number = date.getMonth() + value;
		    if (expectedMonth > 12) {
		        expectedMonth = expectedMonth % 12;
		    }
    
		    if (expectedMonth < 0) {
		        expectedMonth += 12;
	        }
    
		    date.setMonth(date.getMonth() + value);
	        const daysToAdd: number = date.getMonth() >  expectedMonth ? -1 : 1;
	        while (date.getMonth() !== expectedMonth) {

17. **Having the following DB tables diagram:** *=> 10 points*

![](https://github.com/lentyaishe/masa-exam/blob/dev/resources/db-relations.jpg)

You need to write a query that returns for each student his/her parents' information/ Take into consideration that the amount of parents for the child can be different ("Orphan" comment should appear for any child that has no parents defined in the tables). The data should be returned in the following manner:

| Student | Parents |
| --- | --- |
| John Doe | Mark Doe (09-1231231), Jane Doe (09-4132123) |
| Mary Smith | Klark Smith (07-2134897) |

19. **Explain the following piece of code:** *=> 5 points*

		public static padLeft(input: number, places: number): string {
			const zeroes: number = places - input.toString().length + 1;
			return Array(+(zeroes > 0 && zeroes)).join("0") + input.toString();
		}

20. **Fix the following code and fill the required gaps in it by the coding standards. The purpose of this code is to verify the user is a member of a specific role and in case the user is the user data is returned by the isUserPermitted() method. Treat the comments as actual code written that should not be changed:** *=> 15 points*

		interface user {
			id: number;
			firstName: string;
			lastName: string;
		}
		
		interface dbUser {

			last_name: string;
		}
		
		interface role {
			id: number;
			userIds: number[];
		}
		
		interface dbRole {
			id: number;
			user_id: number;
		}
		
		public isUserPermitted(userId: number, roleId: number): Promise<user> {
			return new Promise<user>((resolve, reject) => {
				Promise.all([
					this.getUser(userId),
					this.getRole(roleId)
				])
				.then((results: [user | role]) => {
					return results[1].userIds.indexOf(results[0].id) > -1;
					resolve(results[0]);
				});
			});
		}
		
		private getUser(userId: number): Promise<user> {
			return new Promise<user>((resolve, reject) => {
				// Access to the DB that returns the user data by id as dbUser or null
			});
		}
		
		private getRole(roleId: number): Promise<role> {
			return new Promise<user>((resolve, reject) => {
				// Access to the DB that returns the role data by id as array of dbRole or null
			});
		}


## Part III: Practice on dev machine *=> 33 points*

*No restrictions on online resources usage*

 - Clone the repository: https://github.com/lentyaishe/masa-exam;
 - Switch to `broken-server` branch;
 - Create a new git repository under your personal Github called `masa-exam`;
 - Load the `main` branch of your new repository with the contents of the `broken-server` branch;
 - Each bug in the list should be solved in designated branch.

The following is the list of currently existing problems with the system. :

21. **The server solution cannot be compiled. Fix all compilation issues accordingly.** *=> 10 points*

22. **An attempt to get a list of board types fails.** *=> 5 points*

23. **Any request to the server returns: "A token is required for authentication" even in case the token is supplied for the request.** *=> 5 points*

24. **Addition of the new user cannot be performed. Returned error message: "Incorrect query".** *=> 5 points*

25. **On an attempt to add a new board type an error: "not found" is returned.** *=> 8 points*

# Good luck!!
